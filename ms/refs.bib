  abstract = {The majority of higher organisms in the marine environment display indeterminate growth; that is, they continue to grow throughout their life, limited by an asymptotic size. We derive the abundance of species as a function of their asymptotic size. The derivation is based on size-spectrum theory, where population structure is derived from physiology and simple arguments regarding the predator-prey interaction. Using a hypothesis of constant satiation, which states that the average degree of satiation is independent of the size of an organism, the number of individuals with a given size is found to be proportional to the weight raised to the power -2.05, independent of the predator/prey size ratio. This is the first time the spectrum exponent has been derived solely on the basis of processes at the individual level. The theory furthermore predicts that the parameters in the von Bertalanffy growth function are related as  K{$\propto$} L -1 {$\infty$} K{$\propto$}L{$\infty-$}1 .},

  abstract = {The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.},

  abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data's bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of HMC. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning. Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spatiotemporal models.},

Warming is predicted to alter the structure of natural communities, but robust tests of such predictions require appropriate large-scale manipulations of intact, natural habitat that is open to dispersal processes via exchange with regional species pools. Here, we report results of a two-year whole-stream warming experiment that shifted invertebrate assemblage structure via unanticipated mechanisms, while still conforming to community-level metabolic theory. While warming by 3.8 \textdegree C decreased invertebrate abundance in the experimental stream by 60\% relative to a reference stream, total invertebrate biomass was unchanged. Associated shifts in invertebrate assemblage structure were driven by the arrival of new taxa and a higher proportion of large, warm-adapted species (i.e., snails and predatory dipterans) relative to smallbodied, cold-adapted taxa (e.g., chironomids and oligochaetes). Experimental warming consequently shifted assemblage size spectra in ways that were unexpected, but consistent with thermal optima of taxa in the regional species pool. Higher temperatures increased community-level energy demand, which was presumably satisfied by higher primary production after warming. Our experiment demonstrates how warming reassembles communities within the constraints of energy supply via regional exchange of species that differ in thermal physiological traits. Similar responses will likely mediate impacts of anthropogenic warming on biodiversity and ecosystem function across all ecological communities.},

Whether common mechanisms underpin the size structure of unicellular and multicellular autotrophs is, however, unknown. Using a global data compilation, we show that individual body masses in tree and phytoplankton communities follow power-law distributions and that the average exponents of these individual size distributions (ISD) differ. Phytoplankton communities are characterized by an average ISD exponent consistent with three-quarter-power scaling of metabolism with body mass and equivalence in energy use among mass classes. Tree communities deviate from this pattern in a manner consistent with equivalence in energy use among diameter size classes. Our findings suggest that whilst universal metabolic constraints ultimately underlie the emergent size structure of autotroph communities, divergent aspects of body size (volumetric vs. linear dimensions) shape the ecological outcome of metabolic scaling in forest vs. pelagic ecosystems.},

Size spectra (body mass\textendash abundance relationships) are easier to produce, still incorporate much of the variation in feeding interactions and indicate the strength of the energy transfer efficiency. Here we examined the effect of acid mine drainage on the size spectra of stream macroinvertebrate communities in 25 New Zealand streams with a comparative survey. We predicted that the largest organisms would be most susceptible to acid mine drainage, leading to a reduction in their abundances and associated decrease in the range of body sizes present across the gradient, as well as a reduction in total community abundance. The largest organisms were more sensitive to inputs of acid mine drainage and were absent at the most affected sites. Surprisingly, the smallest body sizes were also removed by acid mine drainage. This led to a reduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the range of body sizes present in mine impacted sites. Total community abundance decreased along the impact gradient. The changes in size spectra were also associated with changes in the proportion of functional feeding groups, suggesting concomitant changes in food web structure. Specifically, communities became dominated by collector browsers and small bodied predators across the gradient. The simplification of the food web structure suggests that communities may be dominated by a few strong energy pathways, lowering their functionality and stability. However, the loss of large bodied predators also reduces top down pressure, probably increasing community stability. Further research is needed to elucidate the cumulative effects of these interacting processes.},

Topological structure and the distribution and magnitude of interaction strengths in food webs have been shown to confer important stabilizing properties. However, our understanding of how variable species interactions affect food-web structure and stability is still in its infancy. Anthropogenic stress, such as acid mine drainage, is likely to place severe limitations on the food-web structures availabe, due to changes in community composition and body mass distributions. Here, we used mechanistic models to infer food-web structure and quantify stability in streams across a gradient of acid mine drainage. Multiple food webs were iterated for each community based on species pairwise interaction probabilities, in order to incorporate the variability of realistic food-web structure. We found that food-web structure was altered systematically with a 32-fold decrease in the number of links and a twofold increase in connectance across the gradient. Stability generally increased sixfold with increasing acid mine drainage stress, regardless of how interaction strengths were estimated. However, the distribution of the stability measure, s, for some impacted communities separated into clusters of higher and lower magnitude depending on how interaction strengths were estimated.

  abstract = {Parameters describing the negative relationship between abundance and body size within ecological communities provide a summary of many important biological processes. While it is considered to be one of the few consistent patterns in ecology, spatiotemporal variation of this relationship across continental scale temperature gradients is unknown. Using a database of stream communities collected across North America (18\textendash\-68\textdegree N latitude, -4 to 25\textdegree C mean annual air temperature) over 3 years, we constructed 160 individual size distribution (ISD) relationships (i.e. abundance size spectra). The exponent parameter describing ISD's decreased (became steeper) with increasing mean annual temperature, with median slopes varying by \textasciitilde 0.2 units across the 29\textdegree C temperature gradient. In addition, total community biomass increased with increasing temperatures, contrary with theoretical predictions. Our study suggests conservation of ISD relationships in streams across broad natural environmental gradients. This supports the emerging use of size-\-spectra deviations as indicators of fundamental changes to the structure and function of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {We develop Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MCHMC), a class of models which follow a fixed energy Hamiltonian dynamics, in contrast to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which follows canonical distribution with different energy levels. MCHMC tunes the Hamiltonian function such that the marginal of the uniform distribution on the constant-energy-surface over the momentum variables gives the desired target distribution. We show that MCHMC requires occasional energy conserving billiard-like momentum bounces for ergodicity, analogous to momentum resampling in HMC. We generalize the concept of bounces to a continuous version with partial direction preserving bounces at every step, which gives an energy conserving underdamped Langevin-like dynamics with non-Gaussian noise (MCLMC). MCHMC and MCLMC exhibit favorable scalings with condition number and dimensionality. We develop an efficient hyperparameter tuning scheme that achieves high performance and consistently outperforms NUTS HMC on several standard benchmark problems, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude.},

This "jagged" spectrum is quite similar to marine spectra characteristic of inshore habitats and offshore surface waters at high latitudes. It is different from the "flat" spectra characteristic of the surface waters of equatorial and subtropical oceans, and of all oceans at depth. The ratio of phytoplankton/zooplankton biomass in lakes ranges from 0.04 to 597.0, with most values falling within the range of 0.5\textendash 3.33 predicted for marine pelagic communities. Particle-size theory predictions of fish standing stock in two study lakes compare quite well to the actual fish biomass measured in the lakes. In contrast to the linear relation between phytoplankton and fish stocks predicted by the theory, a curvilinear relationship exists, suggesting that overall ecosystem productivity may influence particle-size patterns. To facilitate further comparisons between marine and freshwater ecosystems, we argue that additional information on the effects of spatial heterogeneity, nonliving particulate matter, automated measurement techniques, and benthic\textendash pelagic coupling on particle-size distributions is required.}

  abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is increasingly used in ecology, but prior specification remains focused on choosing non-informative priors (e.g., flat or vague priors). One barrier to choosing more informative priors is that priors must be specified on model parameters (e.g., intercepts, slopes, and sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in ecology, like generalized linear mixed models that have a link function and potentially dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior distribution. We suggest that this difficulty can be overcome by simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the results on the scale of the response variable. In doing so, some common choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such implications of prior choices are difficult to foresee without visualization. We demonstrate a workflow for prior selection using simulation and visualization with two ecological examples (predator\textendash prey body sizes and spider responses to food competition). This approach is not new, but its adoption by ecologists will help to better incorporate prior information in ecological models, thereby maximizing one of the benefits of Bayesian data analysis.},

In ecology, biology, and many physical and social sciences, the exponents of these power laws are estimated to draw inference about the processes underlying the phenomenon, to test theoretical models, and to scale up from local observations to global patterns. Therefore, it is essential that these exponents be estimated accurately. Unfortunately, the binning-based methods traditionally used in ecology and other disciplines perform quite poorly. Here we discuss more sophisticated methods for fitting these exponents based on cumulative distribution functions and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate their superior performance at estimating known exponents and provide details on how and when ecologists should use them. Our results confirm that maximum likelihood estimation outperforms other methods in both accuracy and precision. Because of the use of biased statistical methods for estimating the exponent, the conclusions of several recently published papers should be revisited.},
