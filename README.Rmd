This repository contains code to recreate the analyses in Wesner et al. *Bayesian hierarchical modeling of size spectra*. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate how build Bayesian generalized models using the truncated Pareto distribution. For a detailed derivation of the distribution, see @edwards2017 and @edwards2020. All analyses in the paper depend on the `isdbayes` package, which can be found here: <https://github.com/jswesner/isdbayes>.

## Recreate analyses

All figures and tables in the main text can be recreated by running the R scripts in the `\code` folder. In that folder, each figure has two associated scripts: "figure_x.R" and "figure_x_model_and_code.R". The **"figure_x.R"** scripts recreate the .rds and .jpg files of each figure. They plot the model results obtained from the **"figure_x_model_code.R"** scripts.

For example, `code/figure_4.R` creates the figure below, showing how three modeling approaches (a-c) deal with an outlier in the size spectrum parameter $\lambda$.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("ms/fig4hierarchical_regression_plot.jpg"))
```

The code to simulate data and fit these models is in `code/figure_4_model_code.R`. That code requires the installation of `rstan`, `brms`, and `isdbayes`, which in turn require installation of an external C++ compiler. However, all models are already compiled and saved in the `\models` folder. Unless you'd like to refit each model, there is no need to run `code/figure_4_model_code.R`.

## Needing a cluster

For most of the scripts, running the modeling exercise will not work on a personal computer. It requires a cluster, because the models are repeatedly fit 1000 times, resulting in large files. In the code, this is achieved using the `replicate()` function, with n = 1000. To avoid automatically running large models, the replicates in the scripts are set to a lower value, like n = 2.

Some of the fitted model simulations were too big to upload to GitHub. However, the fitted models are summarized (e.g., quantiles of the posteriors) before plotting and all of those summaries are available either in the `\models` folder or the `\posteriors` folder.
